NOTE: I have <leader> mapped to <space>, C- means Ctrl+, M- means Alt+,
      and S- means Shift+

hjkl - movement. can also use arrow keys, including in insert mode
[count]w - move by word. all word movements can be capitalized, e.g. W, to move
           by WORD, which means all non-whitespace chars
[count]b - move by word backwards (or to beginning)
[count]e - move by end of word
[count]ge - move backwards by end of word
[count]| - go to column [count] or EOL if longer than current line
i - insert mode (I to insert at beginning of line)
a - append after cursor (as opposed to i) (A to append at end of line)
[number]r - replace character (R for replace mode)
c[number]{motion} - change mode, e.g. c2e to change until end of next word
(C-)v - visual (block) mode
V - visual line mode
C-[ud] - half page up/down
ESC/C-[ - exit i/v/c mode. I also have jk mapped, except in v-mode
[n]J - join current line with n lines below it. also works in v-mode
M-normal mode key - in insert mode, execute a normal mode command, e.g. u
u - undo (U to undo all changes to a line)
C-r - redo
:earlier/later Nf: go back/forwards to N file writes from current state
y/d - copy/delete in visual mode (yy/dd for line in normal mode)
Y/D - copy/delete from cursor to end of line
P/p - paste before/after cursor
C-o - go back to last point. in insert mode, issue command without leaving insert
C-i - jump forward
:(v)s(plit) - split window (vertically) :sp and :vs also acceptable
:only - close all splits but this one
C-w + direction - navigate between splits (also mapped to C-direction)
C-w + r - swap splits
:tabe - open new tab. NOTE: Use tabs as VIEWPORTS, not in place of buffers
:tab[np] - next/previous tab
:tabonly - close all tabs but this one
:qa - close all tabs at once (or :wqa to write as well)
o - new line under. in v-mode, go to beginning/end of selection
O - new line over. in v-mode, go to beginning/end of selection

[count]@: - repeat last command (and then @@ for subsequent repetitions)
[count]. - repeat last change
gg - top of file
G - end of file
= - indent command. gg=G to indent whole file. NOTE: better to use language server
:b[next|previous] - next/previous buffer NOTE: better to use denite for buf switching
:[ls|buffers|files] - show all buffers/files
:b(uffer) N - go to buffer N ("uffer" is unnecessary). alternately, tab to cycle through buf names
:bd N|<file> - delete buffer
[uU] - in visual mode, change to lower/upper case
>> - indent, e.g. 3>>.. to indent 3 lines 3 times (. repeats action)

               also works in visual mode
:r <file> - read file into buffer
:r ! <command> - read shell command output into buffer
:! <command> | clip - copy command output to clipboard. note this relies on the
                      alias clip being defined as `xclip --selection clipboard`
                      for non-interactive shells, e.g. via ~/.zshenv

M-[kj] - move current or selected line up and down. Also mapped to M-Up/Down

:copen - open the quickfix window
:cclose - close the quickfix window
gq - rebalance text to textwidth
F6 - execute current line in the shell

## Marks

m[key] - set mark. note that lowercase marks are buffer local, whereas
          uppercase marks are global
'[key] - go to mark line. can be prefixed with an action, e.g. d'a = delete until
         mark a
`[key] - go to mark line and column
:marks [keys] - list all marks if called without keys, otherwise those matching
                keys
:delmarks [keys] - delete matching marks. accepts ranges
:delmarks! - delete all marks in current buffer

## Text objects

[op]i[object] - perform op, e.g. d, on inner object, where object can be:
  w - word
  s - sentence
  p - paragraph
  [](){}"' - text surrounded by any of these characters
  t - tag
[op]a[object] - same as above, but includes whitespace, or in the case of
                surrounding quotes, etc., the surrounding chars
[op]% - equiv. to [op]a[paren/bracket]

## Folding

:Fold - fold current buffer using coc.vim.
        Could alternatively set foldmethod. See :help folding
za - open/close fold
zA - recursively open/close fold
zM - close all folds. zm for reduce folding level
zR - open all folds. zr for increase folding level

## Search/replace

\ - use vim-fuzzysearch in normal mode
<C-h> - Find and replace in very magic mode
* - search for word under cursor. g* is partial match.
    press again or use n/N to navigate between matches
# - * in reverse. g# also valid
:noh - remove highlighting, e.g. from *. mapped to <leader>/ (NOTE:
       highlighting currently turned off, so this is moot)
% - find matching paren/brace
:%s/foo/bar/ - whole file. also mapped to C-h
:s/foo/bar/ - current line
<leader>fr - search/replace all files in current dir (cwd, not buffer dir)
tags:
   g - global
   c - confirmation
   e - don't issue error if not found (useful in scripts)
   [iI] - case (in)sensitive

Note that + in regex must be escaped, e.g. \d\+, not \d+ (except see below)

in-expression modifiers:
\[cC] - change to case insensitive (c) and sensitive (C).
	note that ignorecase/smartcase are on
\v - "very magic mode." all ascii characters except [a-zA-Z0-9_] are treated
     as special, so no more escaping [+(){}[]], etc.

Also note that while \n matches a new line, replacement with a newline must use \r.

Other useful characters (that are different from perl syntax. Assuming \v below):
\_s - where s can be any character class, add new-line, so e.g. \_s == [\s\n]
<> - front and end word boundaries

Finally, note that othree/eregex.vim exists to translate from perl-style if the
differences become too frustrating.

## Spelling

:set[local] spell
z= - get suggestions for word under cursor

## Macros

q{0-9a-zA-Z"} - record a macro into the specified register, pressing q again to cease recording
