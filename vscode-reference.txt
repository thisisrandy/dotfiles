## Setup

1) run install.sh
2) run vscode-install-extensions.sh
3) install recommended extensions as desired (should be obvious)
4) TabNine::config and enter API key (check email)
5) Enable Deep TabNine Cloud (in config)

## General

As much as possible, my vim maps have been maintained
C = Ctrl, A = Alt, S = Shift

C-q - quit VSCode
C-p - all (most) purpose search. Covers everything put file contents searching
C-S-p - open command palette (equiv to C-p>)
C-` - toggle the terminal (C-S-` for a new terminal)
C-S-[ik] - shift to previous/next terminal when term in focus
C-S-m - open the problems list
C-b - toggle the sidebar open/closed
C-j - close the bottom panel
C-l - toggle relative line numbers
C-/ - toggle line comment (C-S-a for block comment)
C-Enter - open file (from explorer or CtrlP) in vertical split
gh - hover, synonym for S-k
C-. - quick fix (under cursor, so use gn/gp, then C-.)
F2 - rename var under cursor. VSCodeVim complains about not handling r when
     we use our normal <leader>r map, so just get used to using the VSCode way
C-k w - Close all editors in a group. This is useful to emulate vim behavior
        of closing a split completely on :q. VSCode likes to open new tabs
        for each file in a split (but not for the main group, unless an
        enablePreview setting is configured to false)
C-k z - Enter zen mode
; - filter opened editors. this is different from denite in some important
    ways:
    1) in opens in the group the editor is opened in, not in the active
       group
    2) because of (1), it isn't possible to open files selected this way in
       a new group
    given these issues, C-p is generally more intuitive if multiple groups
    are open

## Explorer

Note that my vim movement keys are bound here

C-n - open the explorer panel (also C-S-e)
C-f - find current file in explorer. technically C-n does this too, but
      trying to make this as close as possible to my vim setup with NERDTree
a - in the panel, create a new file
f - in the panel, create a new folder
d - in the panel, delete the selected node

## Marks

Work a little differently than in vim. I have m/' a-j bound, but the actual
bookmarks are numbered. The prefix Numbered Bookmarks: from the command palette
provides the listing and clearing operations. Operations on going to bookmarks
(e.g. d'a) obviously will not work

## Searching

C-S-f - search all files. in v-mode, seed with selected text
C-S-h - replace in all files. in v-mode, seed with selected text
(S-)F4 - go forwards (backwards) through search results

# Folding

NOTE: spending a short amount of time with the cursor inside a fold
      will automatically open it in VSCode. Also, these are all vim
      mappings, but they are also the only functioning mappings in
      VSCodeVim

zM - close all folds
zR - open all folds
zo - open under cursor
zO - open all under cursor (recursively)
zc - close under cursor
zC - close all under cursor (recursively)

## Git

Most of these are obvious, so no need to write them down. Record any
non-obvious commands or shortcuts here.

NOTE: For multiline commit messages, use the sidebar, *not* the command palette

C-S-g g - open the SCM pane. Note that GitLens turns this into a chord
          to add other functionality. It's just C-S-g by default.
Git:Open changes - bring up diff view
Git:Discard (all) changes - checkout HEAD / reset --hard
<leader>hs - stage selected change (line or selection). this is slightly
             different than gitgutter, which stages the contiguous change.
             this shortcut is only available in the changes view
<leader>hu - undo change. works the same way as staging
[c - move to previous change. works in both editor and compare editor
]c - move to next change. same note as above
