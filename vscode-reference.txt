## General

As much as possible, my vim maps have been maintained
C = Ctrl, A = Alt, S = Shift

C-q - quit VSCode
C-p - all (most) purpose search. Covers everything put file contents searching
C-S-p - open command palette (equiv to C-p>)
C-` - toggle the terminal (C-S-` for a new terminal)
C-S-m - open the problems list
C-b - close the sidebar
C-j - close the bottom panel
C-0 - open the sidebar to wherever it last was
C-l - toggle relative line numbers
C-/ - toggle line comment (C-S-a for block comment)
C-Enter - open file (from explorer or CtrlP) in vertical split

## Searching

C-S-f - search all files. in v-mode, seed with selected text
C-S-h - replace in all files. in v-mode, seed with selected text
(S-)F4 - go forwards (backwards) through search results

# Folding

NOTE: spending a short amount of time with the curson inside a fold
      will automatically open it in VSCode. Also, these are all vim
      mappings, but they are also the only functioning mappings in
      VSCodeVim

zM - close all folds
zR - open all folds
zo - open under cursor
zO - open all under cursor (recursively)
zc - close under cursor
zC - close all under cursor (recursively)
