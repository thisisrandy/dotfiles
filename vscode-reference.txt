## General

As much as possible, my vim maps have been maintained
C = Ctrl, A = Alt, S = Shift

C-q - quit VSCode
C-p - all (most) purpose search. Covers everything put file contents searching
C-S-p - open command palette (equiv to C-p>)
C-` - toggle the terminal (C-S-` for a new terminal)
C-S-[ik] - shift to previous/next terminal when term in focus
C-S-m - open the problems list
C-b - toggle the sidebar open/closed
C-j - close the bottom panel
C-l - toggle relative line numbers
C-/ - toggle line comment (C-S-a for block comment)
C-Enter - open file (from explorer or CtrlP) in vertical split
Alt-up/down - move selected lines or current line up and down. I'm
              specifically noting this here because Alt-j/k cannot
              be bound and therefore do not work :(
gh - hover, synonym for S-k
C-. - quick fix (under cursor, so use gn/gp, then C-.)

## Searching

C-S-f - search all files. in v-mode, seed with selected text
C-S-h - replace in all files. in v-mode, seed with selected text
(S-)F4 - go forwards (backwards) through search results

# Folding

NOTE: spending a short amount of time with the curson inside a fold
      will automatically open it in VSCode. Also, these are all vim
      mappings, but they are also the only functioning mappings in
      VSCodeVim

zM - close all folds
zR - open all folds
zo - open under cursor
zO - open all under cursor (recursively)
zc - close under cursor
zC - close all under cursor (recursively)
